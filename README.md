# Leaf-disease-detection

In this leaf disease detection project, we have made use of CNN (or Convolution Neural Network) to train a model using training data and test it against test data. 

We have defined the model parameters batch_size =32 , epochs=10 and have done the preprocessing of the input data and given the data to the model. 

We have achieved a test accuracy of 90.96 %
